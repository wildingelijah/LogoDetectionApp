# Introduction

This project was designed by myself and three other students (Phillip Pavlich, Aidan Schonewille and Prince Kowser) coding with Java in Android Studio. My primary responsibilities for this project were the three detection algorithms and then compiling all the code together into a working app (I worked very closely with Phillip, while the other members focused on UI and creating our database of team info that we could then access).  

## About The Project

The app is a sports team logo detection application. It allows users to take a photo and it then uses three detection experts (shape, colour and text) to recognize the logo and return the team name and some other information to the user. The primary focus of this project was to work on the documentation side of the software process and so we were only given a single week to perform the actual coding. As such the app does not work perfectly, however all its features function as we intended them. The only flaw with our system is it will not return the correct result 100% of the time. I am however still very proud of my personal work on this app as the logic behind the detection algorithms was very sound and the text and colour detection work close to perfect. Given more time I am confident that it could have been an even more excellent application.

## Files

In order to access the files for this project please click "View on GitHub". 

To run the application download the Sports Logo Recognition folder. Once downloaded you will able to open the project in Android Studio and run the app by either connecting an Android device or by using an emulator from within Android Studio. 

If you would like to view the code (without having to download and run the app) to see how the algorithms work, the code can be found in this file path: app > src > main > java > com > example > a04 > whatteamisthis10. Within the 'whatteamisthis10' folder, all main code files are located. The files I had the most influence on were Experts.java, Image.java and Preference.java.

If you would like to know more about how the app functions, the code itself or my part in the project please feel free to ask me questions at: **elijahwilding@gmail.com**.
