# Introduction

This project was designed by myself and three other students (Phillip Pavlich, Aidan Schonewille and Prince Kowser) coding with Java in Android Studio. 

## About The Project

The app is a sports team logo detection application. It allows users to upload or take a photo and it then uses three experts (shape, colour and text detection) to recgonize the logo and return the team name and some other information to the user. The primary focus of this project was to work on the documentation side of the software process and so we were only given a week to perform the actual coding. As such the app does not work perfectly, however all its features function as we intended them. The only flaw with our system is it will not return the correct result 100% of the time.

## Files

In order to access the files for this project please click "View on GitHub". 

The board.cpp, project.cpp and board.h files contain all our C++ code that runs the game while the .obj files are our chess models that we load into the game through the code. The last file is a makefile that will compile all files together into an executable to run the game.

In order to run the game, download all the files and then navigate to folder in Terminal and enter "make" to compile and link all files into the single game executable. 

It should be noted that all controls and information needed are printed out to the console.
